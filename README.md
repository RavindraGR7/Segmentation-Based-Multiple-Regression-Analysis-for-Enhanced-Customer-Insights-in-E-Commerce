# Segmentation-Based-Multiple-Regression-Analysis-for-Enhanced-Customer-Insights-in-E-Commerce
In this report we have conducted an examination of an e commerce dataset using a method called segmentation based regression. By applying a technique called k means clustering we have divided customers into three groups based on behavioral metrics. For each group we have created regression models to forecast their spending. The findings have revealed the influence of factors such, as time spent on the app and length of membership on customer expenditure. These valuable insights can provide guidance for marketing strategies. Enhancing customer engagement, in e commerce environments.
